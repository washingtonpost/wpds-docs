              What does <span className="italic">"old design system"</span>{" "}
              mean? The old design system is when WPDS and Site components lived
              together. As a lot of you know our design system has grown so much
              this past year. In that time we have learned a lot. One of them in
              particular is how our system scales. As a result, WPDS and Site
              components are now separate. Our tokens have been re-imagined for
              both light and dark mode. Our components scale far better for our
              needs at the post.

              So who is this site for? Well before creating our new design
              system we knew that there will be phase where for those still on
              our legacy system. We wanted to archive our component and token
              logic for others who still need to review and are still working on
              with these components.
