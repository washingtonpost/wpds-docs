## Cycles

-   Bug fixes are released in the form of a patch release. This is the most frequent release type. A patch release is a release that fixes a bug in a token or a component (design or in code). We ship patches on a weekly basis. For example, "1.0.1" is the first patch release.

-   Feature releases are released in the form of a minor release. This is the second most frequent release type. A minor release is a release that adds to our tokens or components (brand new components, tokens too) (design or in code). We ship minor releases on a monthly basis. For example, "1.1.0" is the first minor release.

-   Major releases are releases that add new features to the platform. We ship major releases on a quarterly basis. For example, "2.0.0" is the first major release.
