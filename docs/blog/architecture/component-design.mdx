The components in WPDS UI Kit

will write about how to build them using WPDS UI Kit.

specs should be written for each component. in the specs.mdx in wpds-ui-kit

use the plop templates

## Core tenets

These are our core tenets for component design. We use these to guide our component development. We also use these to guide our component design decisions.

- Our components should do one thing really well! This is why we call them atoms.
- They should refrain from using external dependencies (Cookies, Window Objects, Business Logic, etc).
- They should be controlled by their API or left uncontrolled.
- If a component has multiple DOM nodes such as an Accordion's trigger and it's display, it should be split into multiple components. Such as AccordionTrigger and AccordionDisplay and use a provider component to manage the state across the two (AccordionRoot).
- We should avoid using any DOM APIs that are not supported by evergreen browsers.
- We should should allow modification of styles via the `css` prop using our tokens (component (locally scoped and global) and theme).
- We should use our theme tokens to style our components.
