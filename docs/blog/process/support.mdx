### Using our slack workflow

1. Head over to our #WPDS slack channel where you will kick off your idea!
2. In the channel, simply type /change or /request, and you will see the option to submit an Idea to DS
3. Now, a form will pop up with some questions. Please be as detailed as possible to the best of your knowledge.
4. Hooray! You submitted an idea. The WPDS team will be notified, and now it is open for public discussion across many teams that use WPDS. The team will generate a ticket and prepare it for the next steps of our workflow.
