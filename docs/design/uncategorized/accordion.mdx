## Usage Guidelines

<!-- Start of a guide -->
### Avoid splitting content
The header of the accordion should be a complete sentence or statement. It should never continue inside of the body of the accordion.

<Guide guidance="don't">
<div className="bg-white shadow-3">
   <Accordion
      data={[
        {
          heading: "The rest of this sentence is...",
          children: (
            <div>
               Found in the body and yeah that is no good.
            </div>
          )
        }
      ]}
      />
    </div>
</Guide>

<br/>

<!-- Start of a guide -->
### Container width vs headline width
When possible, the container of the headline should be bigger to avoid it getting too close to the chevron. This can be avoided with enough container space or concise headlines.

<Guide guidance="caution">
<div className="bg-white shadow-3">
   <Accordion
      data={[
        {
          heading: "A really really really long headline that might not fit in this",
          children: (
            <div>
               Found in the body and yeah that is no good.
            </div>
          )
        }
      ]}
      />
    </div>
</Guide>
