## Introduction to tokens
Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system — spacing, color, 
typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data. These can represent anything defined 
by design: color as an RGB value, an opacity as a number, animation ease as Bezier coordinates. 

They’re used in place of hard-coded values to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.
This allows for better-shared control between designers and engineers. Another benefit of using tokens 
is that platforms that do not support WPDS react components are still aligned with the design system at a 
super foundational level.

## Token Types
Tokens can be anything that can be represented as a value. We currently support seven token types.
[Colors](../our-tokens/color) [Icons](../our-tokens/icons) [Typography](../our-tokens/typography) 
[Spacing](../our-tokens/spacing) [Logos](../our-tokens/spacing) [Shadows](../our-tokens/shadows) 
[Motion](../our-tokens/motion). These tokens make up our entire system foundation.
