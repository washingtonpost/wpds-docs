title: Tokens
description: Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system —spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data.These can represent anything defined by design color as an RGB value, an opacity as a number, animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They're used in place of hard-coded values to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences. In addition, this allows for better-shared control between designers and engineers.
