We will review what [WaPo Tachyons](https://tachyons.preview.now.washingtonpost.com/tachyons) is capable of and how it compares with Stitches. We will also review how to write a feature using one or the other to better understand the gaps in Tachyons and how Stitches can fit into them.

## Tachyons

[WaPo Tachyons](https://tachyons.preview.now.washingtonpost.com/tachyons) is a CSS framework for rapid development using small atomic CSS classes. It was an answer to the size limit imposed by [AMP](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/style_pages/?format=websites). With that in mind, the team wrote classes for what was needed for the work. This methodology led to eventual gaps in the framework that we will discuss in the next section.

## Stitches

> "CSS-in-JS with near-zero runtime, SSR, multi-variant support, and a best-in-class developer experience." From ([Stitches.com](https://stitches.com/))

It is fully typed using [CSSType](https://github.com/frenic/csstype) so you can write any CSS you need. There is no limitation by design.
