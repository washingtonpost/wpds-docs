Avatar supports any size token. The default size token is 200.

```jsx withPreview
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box
      css={{
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        width: "100%",
        gap: "$100",
      }}
    >
      <Avatar size="200">
        <img
          src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300"
          alt="An avatar is an atomic component that represents an individual’s identity through a circular photo."
        />
      </Avatar>
      <Avatar size="300">
        <img
          src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300"
          alt="An avatar is an atomic component that represents an individual’s identity through a circular photo."
        />
      </Avatar>
      <Avatar size="400">
        <img
          src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300"
          alt="An avatar is an atomic component that represents an individual’s identity through a circular photo."
        />
      </Avatar>
      <Avatar size="500">
        <img
          src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300"
          alt="An avatar is an atomic component that represents an individual’s identity through a circular photo."
        />
      </Avatar>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

## Guidance

### Supports only 1:1 image ratios

Images set to the height and clipped in a round container. When images are not in a 1:1 aspect they will be distorted.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="information"
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Box
      css={{
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        width: "100%",
        gap: "$100",
      }}
    >
      <img
        height="64"
        src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300"
        alt="An avatar is an atomic component that represents an individual’s identity through a circular photo."
      />
      <Avatar size="400">
        <img
          src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300"
          alt="An avatar is an atomic component that represents an individual’s identity through a circular photo."
        />
      </Avatar>
      <img
        width="64"
        height="96"
        src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2220401/pexels-photo-2220401.jpeg?dpr=2"
        alt="A 64px wide and 96 pixel high image."
      />
      <Avatar size="400">
        <img
          width="64"
          height="96"
          src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/2220401/pexels-photo-2220401.jpeg?dpr=2"
          alt="A 64px wide and 96 pixel high image."
        />
      </Avatar>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Recommended spacing

When inline, Avatars should maintain at least the recommended spacing

<GuideContainer variant="signal">
  <InlineSVG
    width="395"
    height="111"
    path="/img/components/avatar/avatar-label-spacing.svg"
    alt="Image contains two avatars, both showing the headshot of a man with dark brown hair. The first avatar has a red line to the right of the image showing minimum right padding as 050 along with sample text that reads 'User profile'.The second avatar has a red line below the image showing minimum bottom padding as 025 along with sample text that reads 'User profile'."
  />
</GuideContainer>

---

## Accessibility

Avatars should always include alt text of the image.
